    require 'cordova-rake'

If you don't have one

    echo "require 'cordova/rake'" > Rakefile

rake run:android     # Run on Android device or emulator
rake run:ios         # Run on iOS plugged device or emulator

```


## Google | Play Store


### Binaries

Make sure you have `jarsigner` and `zipalign` on your path.
The latter is usually somewhere in /opt/android-sdk.


### Key password

To avoid typing keys on eack apk build:
Rakefile:

    GOOGLE_KEY = 'mykeypassword'

Or an ENV var 'GOOGLE_KEY'


## Apple | App Store


### Binaries

Make sure you have `xcrun`.
Also you need to open the project once in Xcode. (working on xproject gem)

### Developer

To change developer per project:

    APPLE_DEVELOPER = 'Developer X (XXXXX)'
